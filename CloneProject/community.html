   <h1>Community Guidelines</h1> <br> <br>
   <pre>
    We have an incredibly vibrant Rockstar Games community. Every day, millions of players across the globe are working
    their way up the criminal ladder in GTA Online or living the life of an outlaw in Red Dead Online. While these fictional 
    worlds are filled with possibilities, maintaining a foundation of fair play, respect, and player safety for everyone is our 
    highest priority.
   </pre>
   <pre>
    To ensure a positive gaming experience — including a welcoming, fun, and fair environment for our community — we 
    encourage everyone to follow these basic guiding principles and to adhere to our Community Guidelines.
   </pre>
   <pre>
    Additionally, these guidelines outline what behavior and actions we do not allow, as more fully detailed in our 
    Terms of Service, and will be updated periodically to reflect any ongoing changes to the player experience.
   </pre>
   <pre>
    f you observe players not acting in accordance with our Community Guidelines, we strongly encourage you to report this 
    behavior using the in-game reporting tools or through the options available on our website. In addition, we may record and 
    review voice chat, text chat, and other online gameplay data, including by using automated tools, to investigate and 
    enforce violations of our Community Guidelines.
   </pre>

   <h1>Fair Play</h1> <br> <br>
   <pre>
    Playing fairly is integral to an enjoyable experience for everyone. Cheating is disruptive and counter to the spirit of friendly 
    competition at the heart of our online games, while griefing can ruin the fun by creating a negative environment for one or 
    more players. Both behaviors can lead to the loss of player privileges. We define these behaviors as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
    Cheating: Gaining an unfair advantage by using cheats, exploits, hacks, or other third-party software.
   Griefing: Intentionally annoying another player or interfering with their experience and progress by using the game in 
   unintended ways (e.g., spawn killing, stream sniping, driving the wrong way in a Race with the intention to disrupt).
    </pre>

    <h1>Respect</h1> <br> <br>
    <pre>
      Be respectful. Even criminals have a code of honor. Mentoring newer players, assisting other players with tasks like Heist 
      Preps and Sell Missions, or simply being mindful of your microphone’s background noise are all examples of ways to 
      facilitate goodwill and promote positivity for all players in a session. Pay it forward, and you may find other players 
      stepping in to help when you least expect it.

      We do not allow player-to-player harassment, bullying, threats, or attacks against a player’s identity — including, but not 
      limited to:

      Harassment, Bullying, and Threats: Harassing or targeting others including through humiliation, intimidation, or 
      stalking.
